Q: Why Debian?
A: It's easier to install and configure than CentOS (and i haven't use CentOS before)

Q: What is virtual machine?
A: Aâ€¯Virtual Machine (VM) is a compute resource that uses software instead of a physical computer to run programs and deploy 
apps. Each virtual machine runs its own operating system and functions separately from the other VMs, even when they are all
running on the same host. For example, you can run a virtual MacOS machine on a physical PC. 

Q: What it's purpose?
A: VMs may be deployed to accommodate different levels of processing power needs, to run software that requires a different
operating system, or to test applications in a safe, sandboxed environment. 

Q: How does it works?
A: VM working through "Virtualization" technology. Virtualization uses software to simulate virtual hardware that allows 
VMs to run on a single host machine.

Q: Diff between aptitude and apt?
A: Aptitude is a high-level package manager while APT is lower-level package manager which can be used by other 
higher-level package managers

Q: What is AppArmor?
A: AppArmor ("Application Armor") is a Linux kernel security module that allows the system administrator to restrict programs'
capabilities with per-program profiles.

Q: What is SSH?
A: SSH, also known as Secure Shell or Secure Socket Shell, is a network protocol that gives users, particularly system 
administrators, a secure way to access a computer over an unsecured network.
